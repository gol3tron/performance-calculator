        ### Calculation Methods
        
        This calculator performs the following steps:
        
        1. **Interpolates** all parameters (climb rate, temperature, wind, heading) between starting and ending altitudes
        2. **Samples** the climb at 500-foot intervals to account for changing conditions
        3. **Calculates** true airspeed from indicated airspeed using:
           - Pressure altitude (from altimeter setting and true altitude)
           - Temperature corrections for air density
        4. **Determines** ground speed by applying wind components to true airspeed
        5. **Computes** climb gradient as altitude change divided by ground distance traveled
        
        ### Important Notes
        
        - All calculations assume constant indicated airspeed throughout the climb
        - Wind components are calculated based on the difference between aircraft heading and wind direction
        - Temperature and wind conditions are linearly interpolated between starting and ending altitudes
        - These calculations are for planning purposes only and not a substitute for pilot judgment
        - Add appropriate safety margins for actual flight planning

    ## Additional Climb Performance Calculator
    
    This section will include additional climb performance calculations such as:
    
    * Time to climb to desired altitude
    * Fuel consumption during climb  
    * Distance traveled during climb
    * Best rate of climb (Vy) speeds at various altitudes
    * Best angle of climb (Vx) speeds
